This series of write-up's are mainly aimed on boot2root boxes on Hackthebox and Vulnhub. I will also add Binary exploitation and Reversing as I explore these avenues deeper.

There are a ton of write-up's out there already, but documenting these is a crucial step in my learning process as it forces me to iterate through it all one more time.
